Learn Attributes:
priority:
---------
1.Priority- will work with in the class
2.Lower priority will be scheduled first
3.useful for a developer
 enabled/@ignore
 ----------------
 Whether methods on this class/method are enabled.
 enabled is at method level
 @ignore can use at the class level
Default value-True

3.invocationcount:5   c d e d m 
the number of times this method should be invoked
Use:you like to create data  for same information

invocationTimeOut:
The maximum number of milliseconds this test should take for 
cumulated time of all the  invocationcount.
This attribute will be ignore if invocation count is not specified
Do not use it.

threadPoolSize-3
The size of the thread pool for this method. The method will be invoked from multiple threads as specified by invocationCount.
Note: this attribute is ignored if invocationCount is not specified
4.dependsonMethods
--------------------
The list of methods this method depends on.
delete----depends --->create
alwaysrun:
	If set to true, this test method will always be run even if it depends on a method that failed.


priority vs dependsonMethods
priority will work with in the class whereas dom--->across the classes
priority will run even whenn previous priority fails but dom does not work

Timeout:
The maxmium number milliseconds this test should complete if not test fail.
Parameterization:
-No hard code of data inside the java class
-preferredd to automate them by passing from external source(excel,xml,json,db)
 2 types:
 ---------
 -static(parameter)
 if it is common across multiple testcases then u can keep in xml
 Example:url,username,password
 
 
 -Dynamic(DataProvider)
 it is specific to testcase.cannot reuse most of them we have in java(excel)
 Example:company name,firstname,lastname,phonenumber.........
